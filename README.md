This project is related to another one: [Plants Data Organizer](https://github.com/Square-Pot/Plants-Data-Organizer) offline application for desktop. While the desktop app is still available for use, I'm in the process of migrating its features to this web version. 

## Built with:
- [Vue.js 3](https://vuejs.org/) as a frontend framework
- [html5-qrcode](https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode ) library for QR code scanning
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Django REST framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) as a backend framework
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as a data storage
- [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) as a web server
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for orchestration

## Usage:

For end user The Plant Lib app is designed to be simple and easy to use. All you need is a browser on a desktop or mobile device and access to the camera. No additional software is required.
